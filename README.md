# 🚀 NewsReader: Digital Avatar Reading News

## Overview

Welcome to the **NewsReader** GitHub repository! This project creates a digital avatar that reads out custom news articles to users in real time. The project leverages text-to-speech (TTS) technology, natural language processing (NLP), and customizable avatars for a unique news delivery experience. 🎙️📰

## 🌟 Features

- 📰 **Custom News Feeds**: The avatar reads news from sources of your choice - you only need an URL.
- 🧑‍🎤 **Avatar Customization**: Users can choose or design their own avatars to personalize the reading experience.
- 🌐 **Multi-Language Support**: The avatar can speak and read the news in multiple languages, allowing global news delivery.
- 🎨 **Interactive UI**: A visually appealing interface that shows the virtual avatar like the classical news on TV.
